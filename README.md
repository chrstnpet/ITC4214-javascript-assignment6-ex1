Exercise 1 out of 3 for my Internet Programming Class:

Build an HTML page that prompts the user for an integer number. When the user enters an integer value
n and clicks a button the page displays as an HTML element (no alerts) all prime numbers that are less
than or equal to n. A number is prime if its is divisible by 1 and itself. The first prime number is 2.
